**`Course Robots Repository`**

`Vision`   
`Getting started in Robotics courses at RPI can be intimidating for many students, and they can be put off and discouraged by coding requirements when first confronted with them. To alleviate this stress, a beginner-friendly website is being created to allow students to get a grasp of the coding side of robotics. Adding templates and learner code will give them the opportunity to know what to look for and will help them learn how to get desired behavior from the robots they are working with. We also plan to diagnose and document known issues to allow students/faculty to fix them as they appear during class to further streamline the learning and overall pace of the course.`

`Goals`

1. `Develop resources for students in robotics classes as well as TAs and instructors for working with and maintaining the robots utilized in these courses`  
2. `Identify and attempt to resolve issues with robots, and develop and keep maintenance records for robots being utilized`  
3. `Revamp the website to act as a more stable YahBoom documentation, and to be more clear and appealing for users`  
4. `Continue adding to the library of documented code used for robotics students`
